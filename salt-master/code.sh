# in a constant fashion.

# A salt master should have NO hardcoded files and configuration
# but simply be booted bootstrapped by the three following components.
#
# 1. Salt configurations (so we can salt the salt master)
# 2. The packages we share accross the infrastructure
# 3. Cloning every webplatform.org software dependencies.
