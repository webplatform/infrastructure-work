# Bootstrapping a new WebPlatform salt master (step 2)
#
# *The packages we share accross the infrastructure*
#
# This script is meant to be run only once per salt master
# so that every code dependencies are cloned and installed
# in a constant fashion.
#
# A salt master should have NO hardcoded files and configuration
# but simply be booted bootstrapped by the three following components.
#
# 1. Cloning Salt configurations (so we can salt the salt master)
# 2. The packages we share accross the infrastructure
# 3. Cloning every webplatform.org software dependencies.
